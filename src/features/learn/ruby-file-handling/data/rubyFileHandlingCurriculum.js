// FIX NOTE (round 2): NumpyIntroTheory (the shared renderer used by this
// lesson page) switches on `block.type` ("text" | "callout" | "quiz" | ...).
// The previous version of these helpers never set `type`, so every theory
// block silently failed to match and the UI fell back to an auto-generated
// placeholder built from the lesson title + challenge. Also, `block.code`
// is passed directly into <RunnableCodeBlock block={block.code} .../> and
// read as `block.code.label` / `block.code.lang`, so it must be an object
// ({ content, label, lang }), not a bare string. Finally, NumpyIntroTheory
// and the lesson page both read `lesson.chapterTitle` directly (for the
// hero and breadcrumb), so every lesson now carries that field.
